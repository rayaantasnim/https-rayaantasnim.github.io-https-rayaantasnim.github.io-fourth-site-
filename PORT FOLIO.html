	<h2>Current Hobby:</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<div class=para1><span><b><i>Gardening:</b></i></span> I turn my garden into a small paradise through love and patience. First, I prepare the soil, enriching it with organic compost to make it fertile and alive. Then, I carefully arrange colorful flower saplings and plants, ensuring something blooms in every season. Regular watering, timely fertilizing, and diligent weeding keep my plants vibrant and thriving. I add charm with stone pathways, decorative pebbles, and soft garden lights to enhance its beauty. Watching each leaf and flower grow reminds me that this little connection with nature is my greatest joy.<br><br></div>

				<div class="para2"><span><i><b>Reading:</b></i></span> Losing myself in the pages of a book during my free time is my ultimate joy. I step into new worlds, meet fascinating characters, and wander through realms of history or imagination. My heart races during thrilling moments, tears well up at poignant scenes, and laughter bursts out at witty remarks. With each turned page, I discover fresh knowledge or perspectives that broaden my mind. I build a silent kinship with the characters, sharing their journeys. Even in solitude, a book becomes a faithful companion, offering profound, soulful conversations. This quiet adventure truly nourishes my spirit and fills me with happiness.<br><br></div> 

				<div class="para3"><span><i><b>Foreign Currency Collecting:</b></i></span> Whenever I travel or connect with friends abroad, I collect currency as tangible pieces of the world. My collection includes the intricate designs of the Euro, the iconic US Dollar, Japan’s minimalist Yen, Saudi Arabia’s regal Riyal, Bangladeshi Taka, the United Arab Emirates’s geometric Dirham, and Sweden’s artful Krona. Each coin and note tells a story of a nation’s history, culture, and identity. Holding them feels like owning fragments of distant lands. The thrill of discovering a new currency, studying its symbols, and preserving its legacy turns every addition into a mini treasure hunt. This hobby isn’t just about accumulation; it’s my passport to global appreciation.<br><br></div>

				<div class="para4"><span><i><b>Learning Interesting Science:</i></b></span> In my leisure time, I dive into 'Biggan Chinta,' a science monthly magazine that fuels my curiosity. It unravels the mysteries of the human brain’s neural networks, demystifies the technology behind the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and explains mind-bending concepts like time dilation from relativity. I also discover fascinating animal adaptations – from tigers to dolphins. Each article presents complex ideas with clarity, making advanced science accessible. Whether exploring cosmic wonders or Earth’s biodiversity, this magazine turns every page into an adventure. It keeps my mind ignited and teaches me to see the world through a lens of awe and inquiry.<br><br></div>

	<h2 style="color:blue; background-color:#eef20c;">MY AIM IN FUTURE LIFE:</h2>
	<center><div style="text-align:right; color:black;">
		<ol>
		<div class='para1'><li>
			<p><span><i><b>My first goal in life is to learn karate:</b></i></span> The art of self-defense. I believe that the ability to protect oneself is not just about physical strength, but also about developing mental courage and resilience. When a person learns to defend themselves, their self-confidence rises greatly. Through karate, I want to cultivate discipline, patience, and the courage to face life's challenges. Every punch and every step will teach me a new meaning of strength and bravery.</p></li></div>

		<li><div class="para2">
			<p><span><i><b>My second goal is to learn swimming:</b></i></span> Just like the waves of water, life is full of ups and downs. I want to understand the language of water and become one with it. Swimming is not just a physical exercise; it also leads the mind to a new world of peace and calm. Water teaches us how to release burdens and flow with ease. By learning to swim, I want to gain both courage and the ability to move with the flow of life.
			</p></div></li>

		<li><div class="para3">
			<p>
				<span><i><b>My third goal is to learn programming:</b></i></span> I believe programming is like learning a new language through which one can shape the future. It is not only a tool of technology but also a limitless power of creation. I dream of a day when my codes will solve real-life problems and help improve society. I want to become a skilled software engineer in the future, using my knowledge and creativity to invent new technologies. Through programming, I want to shape my thoughts into reality. It is the key that will unlock my path to future success.
			</p></div></li>

		<li><div class="para4">
			<p>
				<span><i><b>My fourth goal is to gain more knowledge about science and mathematics:</b></i></span> I believe that science and math are the foundations of all progress in the modern world. These subjects open the doors of logic, discovery, and innovation. By understanding science, I can explore the mysteries of the universe, and through math, I can sharpen my reasoning and problem-solving skills. I wish to dive deeper into these fields to expand my mind and unlock new ideas. My dream is to use this knowledge to contribute to the betterment of society and make informed decisions in my life.
